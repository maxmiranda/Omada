# Omada: Group Investing Made Simple!
##### By Max Miranda, Daniel Andrews, Robert Iancu & Jeremy Barenholtz

Award-winning project for CalHacks 4.0. Developed a proof-of-concept website for a group investing platform called Omada. The platform would enable users to join groups and propose stocks to those goups to receive proportional returns based ont he amount that they personally invested. Website's backend was coded in Python using PyMongo and MongoDB, while frontend consisted of HTML, CSS & Javascript. Website developed in 36 hours. Won the award for best usage of the Blackrock API in a project. Which we integrated into our real-time stock tracking.

### My roles:
..* Primary designer of the UI of the website in Sketch app. 
..* Wrote the HTML & CSS for the Home, Group, Search, Account & Proposals pages (HTML, shockingly, found in the html file and CSS found in the static file).
..* Configured routes within main.py for each of the pages.
..* Presented the project to major companies like Microsoft, Nasdaq, & Blackrock.
